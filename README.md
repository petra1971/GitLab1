There are many ways to create a file using BASH.

using touch touch newFile.txt only creates.
using echo echo > newFile.txt only creates.
using cat cat > newFile.txt creates and can start appending to file.
using vim vim newFile.txt creates and can start editing the file.

Also the .txt extension is only for convenience and categorization. Some editors view the extension to format the data, but for a txt there's no differnce.

After creating the file, add it to the git repository.
